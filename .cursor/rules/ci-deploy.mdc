# ðŸš¦ CI/CD & Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Tests
```bash
# Frontend Tests
npm run build && npm run start
npm run lint && npm run type-check
npm run test

# Note: No duplicate static analysis calls needed
# npm run lint already includes ESLint with Next.js config
```

## Build Requirements
- **Environment**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` must be set for Vercel
- **Bundle Size**: Frontend < 250 kB gzipped
- **Performance**: Use `dynamic()` imports for non-critical code
- **Images**: All images optimized and using Next.js `<Image />`

## Deployment Rules
1. **All tests must pass** before merge to `main`
2. **Frontend**: Auto-deployed to Vercel from `main` branch
3. **Backend**: Manual deployment trigger on Render.com
4. **Database**: Migrations run automatically on deploy
5. **Environment**: All required env vars set in production

## Performance Budgets
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **Total Blocking Time**: < 300ms

## Monitoring
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Verify API endpoints are responding
- Test critical user flows after deployment
- Monitor performance metrics in production
