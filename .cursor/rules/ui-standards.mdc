# ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Standards for Field Electricians

This document outlines the primary design system, accessibility requirements, and development standards for all user-facing applications built for field electricians. Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory to ensure a consistent, accessible, and usable experience in demanding field conditions.

---

## 1. Core Design System

### 1.1. Color Palette

Colors must be used consistently to reinforce meaning and visual hierarchy. All colors are selected for high contrast and clarity.

- **Primary**: `Electric Blue (#149DEA)` - Used for primary actions, interactive elements, and focused states.
- **Secondary**: `Neutral Gray (#6B7280)` - Used for secondary text, borders, and non-interactive elements.
- **Success**: `Green (#10B981)` - Used for confirmation messages, success states, and valid indicators.
- **Warning**: `Amber (#F59E0B)` - Used for potential issues, cautionary messages, and pending states.
- **Error**: `Red (#EF4444)` - Used for errors, critical alerts, and invalid input fields.
- **Surface**: `White (#FFFFFF)` - Primary background color for content areas in light mode.
- **Dark Surface**: `Off-Black (#111827)` - Primary background for dark mode.

### 1.2. Typography

A clear typographic hierarchy is essential for readability, especially in variable lighting conditions.

- **Header Font**: `Montserrat` - Used for all headings (H1, H2, H3). Should be bold and uppercase for emphasis.
- **Body Font**: `Poppins` - Used for all paragraph text, labels, and user interface copy.
- **Monospace Font**: `JetBrains Mono` - Used for code snippets, technical readings, and data-dense tables.

### 1.3. Spacing & Layout

Consistent spacing creates a clean, predictable layout. Use a 4px base unit for all margins, padding, and layout calculations.

- **Base Unit**: `4px`
- **Small**: `8px` (2x base)
- **Medium**: `16px` (4x base)
- **Large**: `24px` (6x base)
- **X-Large**: `32px` (8x base)

### 1.4. Iconography

Icons should be simple, universally understood, and consistently styled.

- **Library**: Use a single, approved icon library (e.g., Heroicons, Phosphor Icons).
- **Style**: Solid, line-style icons are preferred for clarity.
- **Size**: Icons must be a minimum of `24x24px` to ensure touchability.

## 2. Component Design

### 2.1. Interactive Elements

All interactive elements must be designed for gloved hands and challenging environments.

- **Touch Target Size**: Minimum `48x48px` for all buttons, links, and form inputs.
- **Component States**: All interactive components MUST have visually distinct states for `default`, `hover`, `focus`, `active`, and `disabled`.
- **Focus Indicators**: Focus states must be highly visible, using a combination of the primary color outline and a subtle box-shadow.

### 2.2. Forms & Inputs

Forms are critical for data entry and must be as frictionless as possible.

- **Labels**: All form inputs must have clearly visible labels placed above the input field. Do not use placeholder text as a label.
- **Required Fields**: Clearly mark required fields with an asterisk (`*`).
- **Validation**: Provide real-time validation feedback, showing success and error states on a per-field basis.

## 3. Mobile & Performance

### 3.1. Mobile-First & PWA

Applications must be designed for mobile first and meet Progressive Web App (PWA) standards.

- **High Contrast**: Default to a high-contrast theme suitable for bright, outdoor sunlight. A dark mode theme should also be available.
- **Offline-First**: Critical data and functionality must be available offline. Use background sync to update data when a connection is restored.
- **Installability**: The application must be installable to the user's home screen.
- **Network Feedback**: Clearly communicate network status (online, offline, syncing) to the user at all times.

### 3.2. Images

Image handling is critical for performance and user experience.

- **Component**: Always use the Next.js `<Image />` component for automatic optimization. Never use the raw `<img>` tag.
- **Properties**: Always set explicit `width` and `height` properties to prevent layout shift.
- **Format**: Use modern image formats like `.webp` where possible.
- **Location**: Store static images in `/public/images/`.
- **Alternative Text**: All images that convey information must have a descriptive `alt` attribute. Decorative images should have an empty `alt=""`.

## 4. Accessibility (A11y)

Accessibility is not optional. All products must be usable by people with a wide range of abilities.

- **WCAG Standard**: Target WCAG 2.1 AA as the minimum compliance level.
- **Contrast Ratio**: Text and interactive elements must have a color contrast ratio of at least `4.5:1`.
- **ARIA Roles**: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels and roles on all interactive elements, especially for custom components.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality must be operable through a keyboard, with a logical and predictable tab order.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Test and verify functionality with primary screen readers (e.g., VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android).
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or reduce non-essential animations.
